# Netflix Movie Duration Analysis

Welcome to the Netflix Movie Duration Analysis project repository! This project was completed as part of the Datacamp Data Analysis in Python course. The goal is to analyze trends in Netflix movie durations and determine if there's a decline in average movie length over time.

## Dataset

The dataset (`netflix_data.csv`) contains information about Netflix shows, including title, country, genre, release year, and duration.

## Analysis

Using Python libraries like pandas and matplotlib, we filter out movies from the dataset and visualize the relationship between movie duration and release year. Despite the initial hypothesis, our analysis doesn't show a significant correlation between movie duration and release year.

## Repository Structure

- `netflix_data.csv`: Dataset used for analysis.
- `netflix_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing Python code for data analysis.
- `README.md`: You are here! Provides an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis or explore the dataset further, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Open `netflix_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and execute the code cells.
